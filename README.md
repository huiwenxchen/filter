# Filter


This program applies grayscale, sepia, reflect (reflects image horizontally), and blur filters to images.

To compile:

$ make filter

Run the program following the example below where the command takes in the type of filter (-g, -s, -r, or -b), input file name, and output file name. INPUT.bmp is the file name of the input image and OUTPUT.bmp would be the name of the image after the filter has been applied. -g is grayscale, -s is sepia, -r is reflect, and -b is blur.



EXAMPLE:

$ ./filter -g INPUT.bmp OUTPUT.bmp
